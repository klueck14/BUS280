In many ways, the human life is all about finding how we belong in this world. 
When we do, it has the ability to make us feel like we have a purpose and meaning to be here. 
However, these two terms are not necessarily the same. 
The word purpose always makes me think of the reason we were put on this Earth. 
When I think of this word, I tend to imagine some kind of job. 
Someoneâ€™s job in life might be a doctor, teacher, or even a mom or dad. 
Those roles that people take on give them a title and therefore a purpose for waking up each day. 
Each of those jobs has tasks that they need to complete then in order to perform in that field well. 
Depending on how much you feel you are succeeding in the purposeful aspect of life, you may choose to work harder than others performing the same job. 
The word meaning tends to make me think of why we do the things we do, and usually this is because of an emotion that is tied to whatever it is that has meaning to you. 
For example, being a mom or dad, you have a purpose to fulfill to your children by taking care of them. 
However, the meaning of that purpose then comes when you have the emotions that reflect on how well you wish to perform your purpose. 
When your children mean something to you, it makes your purpose much more a part of your identity and way of life. 
Raising kids, although there can be tough times along the way, allow you to live life for a meaningful reason. 
Meaning can also be attributed to hobbies like sewing. 
Maybe you have an emotional connection to sewing because it is something someone special taught you how to do and you plan on passing this skill onto others. 
Meaning is what makes something special to each individual person and has an effect that makes people have a reason to do something. 
These two words also have some significant similarities. 
Both the purpose and meaning of things in your life go into making life worth living. 
Even without happiness, as long as you have one or the other, or even better, both, your life is much more worthwhile compared to someone who has neither. 
In a way, I believe that by having purpose, one can achieve meaning and vice versa; the two terms go hand and hand. 
Both purpose and meaning can also lead to happiness in your life if you choose to find joy within what gives you purpose and meaning. 
Like the examples given before, if you take pride in having a purpose and that purpose has personal meaning to you, then you may be able to find happiness in going to your job. 
If you find purpose in raising your kid and have created meaning to go along with that, then at times, your kid will bring you joy. 
As one can see, the two terms have some blatant similarities but also differ in their own ways. 
Throughout our lives, we will feel both purpose and meaning, sometimes going hand and hand and other times on their own. 
Either way, both are positive ways that remind us of what our lives truly entail.
